# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were learning the first few steps of coding. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. 

## Installation

To get the project running, I first began with learning what tools I would be using to actually develop an application (Github, terminal, VisualStudioCode, etc.)
I then followed a step by step process, provided through Instructure (CANVAS) to be able to create/ work on both a remote and local term.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
