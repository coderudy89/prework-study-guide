        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML stands for hypertext markup language</li>
          <li>We can enter many types of HTML to include text, images, and even links in our websites/ apps</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
     <li>We connect CSS pages to the head element by adding a link</li>
     <li>We connect Java pages to the end body element by adding a script tag</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
     <li>Text can be broken with a "br" element</li>
     <li>Text size (usually in the header) can be modified to large by "h1" </li>
     <li>Text size (usually in the body) can be modified to small by "h6" </li>
     <li>HTML pages require head, body, main, and footer</li>
        </ul>

          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>CSS stands for cascading style sheet</li>
            <li>Here, we can modify what our webpage/ app looks like</li>
            <li>We can modify text styles, color, image borders, liks, etc.</li>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>Margin, border, padding, content are within CSS box</li>
            <li>We can add inline and internal CSS within the html file</li>
            <li>Most common form of CSS is external, creating a diff. file to edit visuals without direct or permanent affect</li>

            <li>Git checkout plus branch name: will send you to the branch you would like to work in</li>      
        <li>Git version control: add, commit, and push up code in feature branch</li>
        <li>To do so, first send a pull req. with feat. branch as comparison branch and the default branch as the base branch </li>
        <li>Then merge PR so main branch is updated </li>
        <li>In the terminal, pull remote branch into local main branch by entering 'git pull origin main'</li>
      <li>Add new file tabs like CSS and Java by entering "'touch' and 'name of file''' you want to create (ex: touch style.css)</li>

          <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Adds interactivity to our website (clicking buttons, retrieving data, fill out forms, etc.)</li>
            <li>A javascript variable is a container of data (think of box lbeled "shape" and a sphere in it)</li>
